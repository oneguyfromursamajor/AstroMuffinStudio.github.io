        <h1>About Astro Muffin Studio</h1>
        <p><strong>Transmission Origin:</strong> Ursa Major<br>
        <strong>Current Status:</strong> Docked on Earth<br>
        <strong>Translation Accuracy:</strong> ~83%</p>

        <p>We are <strong>Astro Muffin Studio</strong>, an independent creative vessel originally dispatched from the Ursa Major Constellation for observation, data collection, and snack retrieval.</p>

        <p>Somewhere between your deserts and your disc drives, the mission changed.</p>

        <p>Founded by a displaced biological specialist, former Med Tech, and memory archivist, Astro Muffin is a solo operation powered by Kit-Kats, coffee, nostalgia, unresolved trauma, and cosmic radiation.</p>

        <p>This studio isn’t confined to one genre or form. We conjure <em>horror</em>, <em>adventure</em>, <em>comedy</em>, and everything in between. We craft <em>games, characters, clip art</em>, and emotionally unstable pastries with questionable life choices.</p>

        <p>All the creations under this banner channel something real:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Laughter on dying planets.</li>
            <li>Love in forgotten corridors.</li>
            <li>Grief embedded in code.</li>
            <li>Hope hidden in glitch.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Our mission is simple:<br>
        To craft stories that feel like memories.<br>
        To build worlds that whisper to the strange part of your soul.<br>
        To leave you better than we found you.</p>

        <p><strong>This is Astro Muffin Studio.</strong><br>
        Docked temporarily on Earth. Fueled by memory. Driven by signal. Still transmitting.</p>

        <p><strong>We are not from here.<br>
        But we made this for you.</strong></p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Inspiration</h2>
        <p><em>Every story starts with a signal.</em><br>
        Mine came through cracked speakers, blinking pixels, and strange little games that felt like home.</p>

        <p>I wasn’t the only one. There were thousands of us—quiet kids, weird teens, future devs—all orbiting the same strange suns.</p>

        <p>We laughed at sarcastic narrators, solved puzzles that made no sense, and felt real emotion in the dumbest, most beautiful places. Those games didn’t just entertain us. They showed us who we were allowed to become.</p>

        <p>So this is my thank you. To the teams behind:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Space Quest</strong> – Scott Murphy & Mark Crowe</li>
            <li><strong>King’s Quest</strong> – Roberta Williams & Sierra</li>
            <li><strong>Torin’s Passage</strong> – Al Lowe</li>
            <li><strong>Discworld</strong> – Terry Pratchett & the devs who gave his world pixels</li>
            <li><strong>Monkey Island</strong> – Ron Gilbert, Tim Schafer, Dave Grossman & the LucasArts crew</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You made the absurd meaningful.<br>
        You made the silly sacred.<br>
        And you proved that stories didn’t have to be serious to matter.</p>

        <p><strong>So from one voice in the void to another—<br>
        I tip my hat to you, glorious devs.</strong></p>

        <h2>About the Developer</h2>
        <p><strong>Identity:</strong> Unknown<br>
        <strong>Alias:</strong> The One Guy from Ursa Major<br>
        <strong>Current Status:</strong> Human Interface Mode: Enabled</p>

        <p>I’ve traveled half the world—through hospitals and alleyways, ancient ruins and cheap diners. I’ve dined on fine china and off paper plates. I’ve been the storm. I’ve been the shelter.<br>
        <strong>I am contradiction in motion.</strong></p>

        <p>I’ve held the dying and touched the living. I’ve kissed an angel on ancient soil. I’ve been bruised by gods and followed by ghosts. I’ve walked through light and shadow—and somehow came out the other side with a smile and a fraction of my sanity.</p>

        <p>I’m a former microbiologist, med tech, and collector of memories. I’ve studied the body. I’ve studied the breakdown. I’ve tried to understand what makes people fall apart—and what helps them heal.</p>

        <p>I didn’t choose to make art. Art happened because there was nowhere else to put the weight.</p>

        <p><strong>Astro Muffin Studio</strong> isn’t just a studio. It’s a lifeboat. A signal flare. And on the good days? A place to laugh at the madness.</p>

        <p>I create games. I create characters. I create haunted pastries with unresolved feelings. I bring to life horror, adventure, and cosmic absurdity—because life is all of those things mashed together in a meat suit.</p>

        <p>If something I create feels strangely personal—a line, a glance, a quiet moment with a broken pastry—it’s because a piece of me is in it.</p>

        <p>Not the moment itself, but the weight beneath it. A memory. A scar. A flicker of something I couldn’t say any other way.</p>

        <p>And if it ever feels like I’m speaking to a part of you you thought no one could see... maybe that’s because I’ve stood in the same dark and looked for light, too.</p>

        <p><strong>I’m not from here.<br>
        But I’m still trying to make something beautiful while I’m visiting.</strong></p>
